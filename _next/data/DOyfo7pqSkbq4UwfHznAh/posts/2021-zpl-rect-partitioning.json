We found <a href=\"https://halt.software/dead-simple-layouts/\">Martin Cohen's</a>  <strong>RectCut</strong> approach very useful for sketching out basic layouts for our apps. Our implementation brings in a new type called <code>zpl_aabb2</code>, providing a simple bounding box you can easily cut, contract, or extend. We highly recommend checking out the posted link above for the rationale behind this approach.</p>\n<p>On top of that, new conversion methods have been made to easily switch between <code>zpl_rect2</code> and <code>zpl_aabb2</code>, as well as a bunch of utility methods that should help you out getting started!</p>\n<p>The demo from the cover is available freely at <a href=\"https://github.com/zpl-c/zpl/blob/master/code/apps/extras/layouts.c\">our GitHub repo</a> as well as the assets associated with it.</p>\n<p>With this small addition, we've also improved some portions of the library, namely in the math module section.</p>\n<p>We really love bringing in cool ideas to the library, while making sure we stay solid, I hope you will enjoy this update.</p>\n<p>See you next time!</p>\n","coverImage":"/assets/zpl-layouts.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
