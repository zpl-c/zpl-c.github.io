Hi there!

First of all we would like to wish you a lot of luck in this new year!

We have prepared the following roadmap for the upcoming months:

Hi there!

First of all we'd like to wish you a lot of luck in this new year!

We've prepared the following roadmap for the upcoming months:

We will try to improve and extend the support of various architectures (namely the **ARM family**) and platforms (iOS, Android, Emscripten, ...) in the **zpl** library. 
There is a long journey ahead of us, but hopefully a fun one!

Our **enet** fork will receive an upgrade in the deployment process, patches and CI setup similar to the one used in zpl.

**Enet** will be (once more) completely reorganised to improve the development workflow, akin to how we currently organise **librg** or **zpl**.
Releases will always provide the expected amalgamated single-header version of the library however.

We will keep you updated on any changes or progress during the development, thank you for supporting us!
