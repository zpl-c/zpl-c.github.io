Hey everyone!

A quick announcement.

We've successfully tested both zpl and librg on a set of different ARM based machines.

More specifically on our own **Raspberry Pi 4B** with **ARM_Cortex-A72** on **Raspberry OS (32 bit)**, as well as on a brand new **Apple M1 Chip (64 bit)**.

Both libraries compile successfully and all the tests run without any issues. üéâ

Cheers!
