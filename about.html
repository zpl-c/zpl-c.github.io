                    This moment has shaped librg into a powerful library with a simple purpose: Entity data streaming.
                    Narrowing the scope down to entity streaming, we've optimized our library for use in
                    any environment desired. librg would allow us to pack streamable data within a grid-based world without dependency on networking setup or user application.

                    We've decided to reboot ReGuider Framework under a new name: librg.
                    This rewrite would drop support for scripting and resource management in favor of more flexible
                    and powerful entity data streaming. It relied on a networking library called <a href="https://github.com/zpl-c/enet" target="_blank">ENet</a>
                    which would connect players together and stream entity data on a grid-based world. We've used this iteration of a library on
                    a project called <a href="https://youtu.be/2s3Ox5_4rQo" target="_blank">Mafia Oakwood</a> which was an unofficial multi-player modification for a legendary game.

                    A fork of <a href="https://github.com/gingerBill/gb" target="_blank">gingerBill's gb</a> library, <a href="https://github.com/zpl-c/zpl" target="_blank">zpl</a> has shaped up to provide a wide range
                    of additions, improvements and design changes that would improve C/C++ development. Over time,
                    we've implemented a support for various platforms and architectures. The library went through many changes until
                    it became the ❤ of our organisation.

                    The first version of our library, called <b>librg</b>, would surface under ReGuider Framework.
                    Originally designed to provide a suite of tools used for game dev multiplayer development, it has handled
                    a wide range of tasks, from creating a fully networked game session, scripting (Squirrel), and resource management
                    to network-bind culling. We've used it internally to develop multiplayer solutions for our in-house projects.
